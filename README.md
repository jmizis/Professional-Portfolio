# Professional-Portfolio
First I created a new repository on Github named "Professional-Protfolio".
After that I cloned my new repsitory on my computer using git bash under my Homework file.
Now that I have it cloned to my computer I opened Visual Studio Code to just README.md.
I created a new index.html file with the README.md so I can start my coding for my new profolio.
Now I can begin!!
I start with with the Head, giving my website a title "Mizis's Protfolio"
Next I create a link stylsheet for my CSS under my title. 
Now I'm ready to start my Header.
Gave the header of the site my name "John Mizis" with my picture.
Next, I created my nav bar with About me, Work, Contact me. 
Next came the main part of mysite.
My section contains the "about me" section folllowed up by my "work" section and my three projects.
My first project takes us to my Github under my first assignment that i completed.
I created flexbox for my "about me" and "work" section. 
Under my css link I have the display, justify-content for them.
Finally i created the footer of the site "contact me"
Under that you can find the direct link to my linkedin, and email.com
Once I checked everything over I was ready to move it to my Github repository.
Using gitbash I git add -A, git commit -m, and finally git push.
Once on there I went to settings, git pages and created my deploy link.
Next I copy my deploy link, and my repository link and paste both in our bootcamp site under Module 2 challenge.
