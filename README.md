# Professional-Portfolio
## Description

For this assignment the goal was to create our first portfolio site. By creating this we will go back and add projects to it that we complete throughout our course. The goal to have a profile picture with a about me section. You can also find a section with my projects and on the bottum of the site you can view my contact information. 




## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push.
